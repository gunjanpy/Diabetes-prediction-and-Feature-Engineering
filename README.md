# Diabetes Prediction and Feature Engineering

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques and performing feature engineering to enhance model performance. The dataset used contains medical and demographic features related to diabetes risk. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately identifies individuals at risk of diabetes.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various health parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, and other relevant features. It has been preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering was performed to improve the predictive power of the model. This includes:
- Handling missing values using imputation techniques.
- Feature scaling and normalization.
- Creating new features based on domain knowledge.
- Feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis and recursive feature elimination.

## Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for diabetes prediction:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

## Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using various performance metrics, including:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC Score

## Results
The best-performing model was selected based on cross-validation results and overall performance on the test set. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost lightgbm
```

## How to Run
1. Load the dataset.
2. Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
3. Train and evaluate machine learning models.
4. Compare model performance and select the best model.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of feature engineering and machine learning for diabetes prediction. Further improvements can be made by exploring deep learning techniques or incorporating additional medical data.
